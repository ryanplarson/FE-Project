% This is a part of the UMN (University of Minnesota) Beamer presentation theme.
% Other parts are in files beamercolorthemeUMN.sty and beamerouterthemeUMN.sty
% All three files are needed if you want the theme to work properly.
%
% This file, beamerthemeUMN.sty, defines the presentation theme. 
% This is essentially the main file for the theme, that is invoked
% if you give command \usetheme{UMN} in your Beamer tex-file.
%
% There are two ways to make things work. 
%    1) Simple - put all three files in the same folder as you tex-file.
%       You will have to haul them around every time though.
%
%    2) Harder - put these into appropriate sub-directories of the beamer
%       installation directory. The current file should go into the themes
%       directory, the colortheme file - into the color directory, and the
%       outertheme file - into the outer directory. You will have to do it
%       on each computer you use, though.
%
% Do not try to rename any of the files. The words beamerXXXtheme are apparently
% ignored by Beamer, so do not try to say: \usetheme{beamerthemeUMN}, because
% Beamer will search for file named beamerthemebeamerthemeUMN.sty for it.
%
% See Beamer user guide for details on themes. But there is virtually no
% information on how to create a theme, I had to figure it out myself.
