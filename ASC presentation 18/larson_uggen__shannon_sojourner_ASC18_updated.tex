\begin{frame}{Questions}
\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}

\item How has the proliferation of criminal record altered chances in the U.S. labor market?

\item Is the effect robust across subpopulations? Chiricos et. al. (2005), Western (2002)

\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\section{Literature}

\begin{frame}

\begin{block}{Theory}
\begin{itemize}
\item Labeling and Stigma (Goffman 1963, Becker 1963)
\item Age-Graded Life Course (Sampson and Laub 1997)
\item Statistical Discrimination (Arrow 1973) and Signaling (Bushway and Apel 2011)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Empirical}
\begin{itemize}
\item Experimental Audits: Pager (2003), Uggen et. al. (2014)
\item Observational data: Sampson and Laub (1993), Western (2002), Stoll and Bushway (2008), Apel and Sweeten (2010), Harding et. al. (2018)
\item No record effect on worker performance in Military context (Lundquist et. al. 2018)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Data}

\begin{frame}{Data}
\begin{block}{}
\begin{itemize}

\item Balanced Panel of U.S. State-Years 1980-2010 (50*31=1,550 obs.*)
\item Population: U.S. adults ages 18-54 (excludes those incarcerated)
\item Current Population Survey data aggregated to state-year level
\item Merge covariates from UKCPR, CSP, SSA
\item Leverage new state-year estimates of population with felony record (Shannon et. al. 2017)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item estimated via demographic life-tables of correctional out-flows 
  \item adjusts each cohort accounting for mortality and recidivism
  \item excludes those currently under correctional supervision
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Measures}

\begin{frame}{Measures}
\begin{block}{Outcome Measures}
\begin{itemize}

\item DV: not employed share (unemployed+NILF)/population 
\item IV: felony history percentage
\item Time-Varying Controls:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Population age shares
  \item Overall unemployment rate lags (proxies for business cycle)
  \item Disability, marriage, and bachelor's degree rates
  \item Effective wage, unemployment compensation, mean TANF max
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Analytical Strategy}


\begin{frame}{Analytical Strategy}
\begin{block}{Generalized Difference-in-Difference}
\begin{itemize}
\item "treatment" as dosage of felony history
\item assumes units would follow a common employment trajectory with equivalent doses
\item modeled as a "two-way" fixed effects panel model
\item $Y_{st} = \beta F_{st} + \alpha X_{st} + \lambda_s + \lambda_t + \epsilon_{st}$
\item stable, unobserved influences across states and years captured by fixed effects
\item causal if*: unobserved within state changes, not due to common time shocks, independent of changes in $F_{st}$
\item cluster SEs by state and year
  \begin{itemize}
  \item state: heterskedasticity and autocorrelation across time within state
  \item year: spatial autocorrelation within year
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}
