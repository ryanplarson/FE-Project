% This is a part of the UMN (University of Minnesota) Beamer presentation theme.
% Other parts are in files beamerouterthemeUMN.sty and beamerthemeUMN.sty
% All three files are needed if you want the theme to work properly.

% This file, beamercolorthemeUMN.sty, defines the presentation colors. 
% See Beamer user guide for details on colors, although the information there
% is very limited, I had to figure out just about everything by trial and error. 

% See comments in beamerthemeUMN.sty on how the whole thing is supposed to work.
